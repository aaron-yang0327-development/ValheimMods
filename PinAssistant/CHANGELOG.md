# Changelog
- **v1.0.0**
	- Initial Release
- **v1.0.1**
	- Changes		- Changed the hover description for "Look Tick Rate" into a more detailed explanation, the prior message might confuse people.		- Changed default Redundancy Distance from 30 to 20 (I found that it might be too big of a distance to check for redundancy).
		- Slightly organized README.md and added a suggestion section.
	- Fixes
		- Fixed sub string searching in TrieNode when a prefix exists in the entry.
			- ex. Runestone ID and Copper ID. And your search is "Rock_Copper(Clone)" it only checked R's descendant but didn't check the rest of the letters so it never reached C of the 'Copper ID'.
- **v1.1.0 Trackable Types**
	- New
		- Option to choose what types of objects you'd like to look for to increase performance (albeit negligible).
			- Hover each type in the config manager to figure out which do you want to be detectable.
	- Changes
		- Separated changelog to CHANGELOG.md.
		- Backend
			- Added Dictionary class version for whenever there's changes to how tracked objects are saved in future version.
			- Made UI elements public for modders to change its style (although you can probably do that through just Instance property alone).
			- Updated Jotunn library from 2.12.6 - 2.14.0 (didn't think about updating the template I used).
			- Cleaned up some codes.
	- Fixes
		- Fixed build uploads to not contain versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 zips. (sorry for the extra file size).
- **v1.2.0 Search Update**
	- New
		- Added the ability to search Pins on the map for situations when your map is too crowded with Pins.
			- Press Tab while the map is open to show/hide the window.
			- Enclose the search keyword with `"` to search pins with the exact name. ex. `"Mushroom"`.
			- You can also change its visibility on world startup/mod enabled through the config.
			- If you have Pinnacle and want both of them to show/hide together, just disable `Show Search Window on startup` and toggle off and on `Enabled Mod`.
	- Backend
		- Plugin.cs 		
			- refactored to use MonoBehavior OnEnable/Disable (forgot this exists and can be used similarly to my situation).
			- added unsubscription to some missed events on OnDestroy (not really important since plugins don't get destroyed).
		- PinAssistantScripts.cs
			- refactored to not initialize on Instance reference, but instead only create a new instance on Init() (to follow init convention on other classes).
		- MinimapPatches.cs
			- refactored to contain patches in one class only instead of many classes (didn't know you can do it this way.
		- Changed README.md to include new search feature.
