# Changelog
- v1.0.0
	- Initial Release
- v1.0.1
	- Changes		- Changed the hover description for "Look Tick Rate" into a more detailed explanation, the prior message might confuse people.		- Changed default Redundancy Distance from 30 to 20 (I found that it might be too big of a distance to check for redundancy).
		- Slightly organized README.md and added a suggestion section.
	- Fixes
		- Fixed sub string searching in TrieNode when a prefix exists in the entry.
		- ex. Runestone ID and Copper ID. And your search is "Rock_Copper(Clone)" it only checked R's descendant but didn't check the rest of the letters so it never reached C of the 'Copper ID'.
- v1.1.0
	- New
		- Option to choose what types of objects you'd like to look for to increase performance (albeit negligible).
	- Changes
		- Separated changelog to CHANGELOG.md
		- Backend
			- Added Dictionary class version for whenever there's changes to how tracked objects are saved in future version.
			- Made UI elements public for modders to change its style, (although you can probably do that through just Instance property alone)
			- Updated Jotunn library from 2.12.6 - 2.14.0 (didn't think about updating the template I used)
			- Cleaned up some codes
	- Fixes
		- Fixed build uploads to not contain versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 zips. (sorry for the extra file size)
